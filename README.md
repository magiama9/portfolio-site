# portfolio-site

## Who cares?
Most developers have a portfolio page, and most of them look exactly the same. For the most part, there’s nothing wrong with that. However, when I built out my own portfolio site, I wanted it to be as much of a learning experience as any other project I set out to build.

## How It’s Built
This site is built and themed using Gatsby as a static site generator using react components. Content is managed and served from Netlify-CMS, and the page is served from GitHub Pages.

This was the first site I built using Gatsby, and the customization and easy build process amazed me. The site is designed to be accessible, modern, and information forward.

## What’s here
This site hosts posts about projects both “complete” (I’m not sure any of them will ever really be complete.) and in-progress. I try to go more in depth about the actual development process and the reasoning behind the decisions that went into the projects.
