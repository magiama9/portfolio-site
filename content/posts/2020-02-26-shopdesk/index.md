## WHAT'S SHOPDESK?

ShopDesk is a modern e-commerce platform designed for small business from the ground up. Using ShopDesk, you can reach the largest customer base in the world...anyone with an internet connection. ShopDesk lets you sell your products, manage your inventory, and more importantly, get back to running your business.

If you visit the deployed application, you won't see ShopDesk's logo anywhere. The site is an example of what anyone can build in minutes using ShopDesk's intuitive platform.

## WHY I BUILT IT

Retail is changing, and small business can't keep up. With giants like Amazon and Walmart in the arena, you're forced to either dilute your brand and eat commissions, or lose out on a huge customer base.

I'm a web developer, but you shouldn't have to be one just to sell your products on the internet.

## User Stories

Business Owner --- As the owner of a store, I want to be able to reach customers with an e-commerce platform so that I can expand my business and increase revenue.

Customer --- As a consumer, I want to be able to easily find and purchase great products from my favorite retailers online so that I don't have to leave the house.

Store Manager --- As the manager of a store, I want to be able to easily check and update inventory so that we don't run out of products that customers want and need.
