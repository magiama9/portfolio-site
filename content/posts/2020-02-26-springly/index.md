## SPRINGLY (ALPHA 0.0.1)

Job searching isn't easy, but it doesn't have to be quite so hard. Springly is a tool designed to assist job-seekers in organizing their job search.

Springly was born out of the frustration that everyone I know experiences while job searching. The process seems endless with no roadmap to success. It's easy to lose track of job applications and professional materials, especially when you're tailoring your applications to each job.

I would love to hear your personal career story and integrate your feedback into Springly. If you would like to participate,  please visit my [survey](samrandels.io/survey).

## WHAT IT IS

Springly is command and control for your job search. No matter how you find and apply to jobs, Springly provides a dashboard to view your active applications, your wishlist jobs, and your scheduled phone screens and interviews.

Springly also helps keep you on top of your job search by providing a Kanban style task list and intuitive interface. I understand job searching already feels like a gargantuan task; keeping track of it should be easy.

## WHAT'S NEXT
Springly is currently in the very early planning and development stages. The current application provides just a simple dashboard overview of your job search. The first feature in the pipeline is the ability to import jobs and job descriptions from a variety of sites, starting with Indeed and LinkedIn.

Next up, you'll be able to more easily plan out your job search with a more intuitive interface, built in React.

...and so much more.
